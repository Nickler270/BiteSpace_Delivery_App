## Issue Description
Develop a high-level design for the BiteSpace app's user interface to establish the foundational structure and visual style. The design should prioritize usability, modern aesthetics, and alignment with BiteSpace's brand.

## Key Requirements
- Wireframes: Create wireframes for the main screens:
  - Home screen (featured restaurants, search bar, and user-specific recommendations).
  - Restaurant details page (menu, reviews, and photos).
  - Order summary and checkout page.
- Style Guide:
  - Define a color palette reflecting a vibrant and inviting food app (e.g., warm tones, appetizing imagery).
  - Select typography for headings, body text, and labels.
  - Define button styles, input fields, and other UI components.
- Navigation:
  - Plan a simple and intuitive navigation hierarchy.
  - Decide between bottom navigation, side menu, or tabs for accessing core features.
- Responsiveness:
  - The design should be mobile-first but scale seamlessly to larger screens like tablets or desktops.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Wireframes
- **Scenario:** Wireframes for key screens are created  
  - **Given** I am designing the BiteSpace user interface  
  - **When** I draft wireframes for the main screens, including the Home screen, Restaurant Details page, and Order Summary page  
  - **Then** the wireframes should display all required elements and follow best practices for usability and aesthetics.

### Style Guide
- **Scenario:** A style guide is created for the UI  
  - **Given** the app requires a consistent visual style  
  - **When** I define the color palette, typography, button styles, and other UI components  
  - **Then** the style guide should reflect BiteSpace’s brand identity and include vibrant, inviting design elements.

### Navigation
- **Scenario:** Intuitive navigation is designed  
  - **Given** I am planning the app’s navigation hierarchy  
  - **When** I decide between bottom navigation, side menus, or tabs for core features  
  - **Then** the navigation should be easy to understand and allow seamless access to all key sections of the app.

### Responsiveness
- **Scenario:** The design is responsive to different screen sizes  
  - **Given** BiteSpace needs to be usable on both mobile and desktop devices  
  - **When** I create the UI layout  
  - **Then** the design should adjust fluidly for various screen sizes, maintaining usability and visual appeal.

### Clickable Prototype
- **Scenario:** A prototype of the UI is created  
  - **Given** the team needs to review the design  
  - **When** I develop a clickable prototype using tools like Figma or Adobe XD  
  - **Then** the prototype should showcase all key screens and navigation, allowing for team feedback.
